# 00. Intro

Hello and welcome to my coding course to build a full-fledged admin dashboard by the best tech stack in the world: Nextjs 15, React 19, Drizzle Orm, and Shadcn UI.

This admin dashboard is the updated version of acme project on https://nextjs.org/learn
Here I walk you though all steps to build a real-world admin dashboard from scratch.

- we will develop a responsive homepage that follows the best design practices we have. A header with hero section and call to action button to login.
- A dashboard screen with sidebar navigation on desktop and header menu on mobile device.
- We'll create stat boxes, bar charts, data tables on dashboard page.
- invoice management from where you can filter, create, update and delete invoices.
- also we'll create customers page where you can filter users based on their name and email.

My name is Basir and Iâ€™ll be your instructor in this course. I am a senior web developer in international companies like ROI Vision in Montreal, and a coding instructor with 50 thousands students around the world.

You need to open the code editor along with me and start coding throughout this course.
I teach you:

- creating admin dashboard web app by next.js 15 and react 19
- designing header, footer, sidebar, menu and search box by shadcn and tailwind
- enable partial pre-rendering to improve website performance
- create database models by drizzle orm and postgres database to handle invoices, customers and users.
- handling form inputs by useActionState and Zod data validator
- updating data by server actions without using any api
- rendering beautiful charts by recharts
- handling authentication and authorization by next-auth
- and toggling dark and light theme by next-theme
- at the end you'll learn how to deploy admin dashboard on vercel.

I designed this course for beginner web developers who want to learn all new features of next 15 and react 19 features in a real-world project. If you are or want to a web developer, take this course to become a professional web developer, have a great project in your portfolio and get a job in 22 million job opportunities around the world.

The only requirement for this course is having basic knowledge on react and next.js.
